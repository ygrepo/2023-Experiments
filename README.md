    - **presentation**: I created a dynamic presentation that not only highlighted my own work but also showcased cutting-edge research papers related to modeling cancer drug response. 
    - **clinical_data_analysis**: I performed a statistical analysis of clinical data and developed two outlier detection algorithms. Additionally, I proposed an advanced open-source solution for further evaluation.
    - **claim_analysis**: I conducted an in-depth analysis of a prominent healthcare institution's 2020 claim dataset to identify the correlation between patient demographics (age, gender, and race/ethnicity) and disease status with total healthcare costs. The resulting report offers valuable insights into the factors that drive healthcare costs and can inform policy decisions aimed at improving healthcare affordability and accessibility.
    - **amino_acids_library_generation**:I developed a three-step approach to improve the screening of phage variants. Firstly, I scored and ranked the observed variants. Secondly, I identified sequence structures among the enriched variants. Lastly, I designed a new set of phage variants to enhance the enrichment. My approach was inspired by the research paper 'Targeting AAV vectors to the CNS via de novo engineered capsid-receptor interactions'."
